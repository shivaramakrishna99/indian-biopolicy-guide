The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOH&FW) under the Government of India issued a guideline for the transfer of human biological material in 1997 titled [Guidelines of Transfer of Biological Material](https://main.icmr.nic.in/content/download-guidelines-transfer-biological-material). The materials that fall under this category include organs and parts of organs; cells and tissue; subcellular structures and cell products: blood; gametes (sperm and ova); embryos and fetal tissue; wastes (urine, faeces, sweat, hair, epithelial scales, nail clippings, placenta etc.); and cell lines from human tissues. By the guidelines, 

1. -Exchange of material for therapeutic purpose to patients does not require authorisation

2. -Authorisation is not required when the institute participating in collaboration with foreign institute is under World Health Organization (WHO), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) or such government overseen bodies

3.  -For private institutes, medical colleges and other educational and research institutes under the University Grants Commission (UGC), proposal for movement of human biological samples is to be submitted to the ICMR for obtaining an endorsement from the Health Ministry Screening Committee (HMSC), for which ICMR is the Secretariat. 

The ICMR sets up the committee with experts from relevant fields for discussing proposals on a case by case basis before making a decision. It is to be noted that HMSC was constituted by GoI way back in the early 1980s to "screen and approve the international collaborative proposals in the field of biomedical health research". 

The Committee comprises distinguished representatives from the Ministry of Health & F.W. (Department of Health, Family Planning, NACO, AYUSH and Directorate General of Health Services); Ministry of External Affairs; Ministry of Finance; Department of Biotechnology; Department of Science and Technology; Directorate General of Armed Forces and Medical Services and is chaired by the Secretary, Department of Health Research (DHR), MOH&FW, GoI.

It is noteworthy that ICMR has signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) or Letters of Intent (LoIs) or given joint statements with several countries across the world and whenever there is a transfer of human biological material from India to the foreign lab, or vice-versa, the 1997 guidelines impose a submission of duly signed Material Transfer Agreement that contains the following information: nature, number and quantity (% wise) of material to be sent; purpose/need of transfer; type of investigation(s) to be done utilizing the material; institution(s)/scientist(s) to whom material is to be sent along with their addresses.

However, in 2016 a gazette notification from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry regarding the import/export policy for Human Biological Samples for commercial purposes nullifies the requirement of any approval for the transfer of human biological samples as long as the institute/agency involved in the movement submits an undertaking to follow the WHO/DGFT (Directorate General of Foreign Trade) laid guidelines regarding handling, shipping, packaging and disposal; along with a document containing the sample details.

Shipping/Packaging: For both human and non-human biological samples, the shipping and packaging policies in India follow the 2015-2016 WHO guidelines for [Transport of Infectious Substances](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/149288/WHO_HSE_GCR_2015.2_eng.pdf;jsessionid=F22E6ABFD9162CB40719D7CF31C045FE?sequence=1). The guidelines are listed for infectious substances (category A, B, exemptions), biological products, GMOs, medical and clinical wastes. The guideline specifies that all biological samples need to be assigned UN numbers based on their type and follow shipping/packaging regulations based on the UN number. The following are the UN numbers for infectious agents. 

-   -Infectious substances category A, affecting humans: UN 2814

-   -Infectious substances category A, affecting animals: UN 2900

-   -Infectious substances category B: UN 3373

-   -Exemptions: No UN category

It also includes the regulatory body based on mode of transport, whose regulations need to be followed for determining whether the mode of transport is applicable, and if yes, what are the shipping and packaging procedures. For India, the major modes of international transport include air and ship which are regulated by [International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)](https://www.icao.int/safety/dangerousgoods/Pages/default.aspx) and [International Maritime Organisation (IMO)](https://www.bifa.org/media/4544564/bp-3-the-international-maritime-dangerous-goods-imdg-code.pdf) respectively.
