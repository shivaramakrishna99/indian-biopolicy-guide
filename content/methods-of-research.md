# Methods of Research 

Our modus operandus involved the following sequence of events:

1.  -As our team members got familiar with the regulatory bodies in India such as the [DBT](https://dbtindia.gov.in/) and [ICMR](https://www.icmr.gov.in/) during our iGEM participation in 2019, we searched the relevant policies on their websites and came across the 1989 Act and 1997 rules concerning non-human and human biological materials, respectively.

2.  -In addition, the RCGM repository entailing the rules, acts and guidelines passed by the Department of Biotechnology so far helped us gain access to a lot of relevant policies required for this hackathon. 

3.  -Furthermore, to compare and contrast the biosafety and shipping policies in India with other regions of the world, we chose a representative country from 3 different continents - USA from the American region, Germany from the European region and Australia from the Australian region. 

4.  -Our team also looked into the supply chain model of vaccines to understand the policy relaxations given by the GoI for ensuring their rapid movement from which we got inspiration for prospective changes in the implementation level.
