# Case Study - Policy relaxations for SARS-CoV-2 research in India

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an enormous impact on the policies that govern the shipment of samples across and within the Indian borders. With GoI's strong commitment to furnish an enabling ecosystem for research to develop diagnostic tests, therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. In endeavouring this, a sharing mechanism for biological/clinical samples and data between institutions and researchers was imperative and was realized by the setting up of 17 biorepositories across India. 

The Office Memorandum dated 07.06.2021 titled the *Standard Operating Procedures for exchange of infectious biosamples/biospecimens from biorepository* recognizes these biorepositories and have given rise to the production of two indigenously developed vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin. India was self-reliant of its vaccines and was able to export vaccines to many needy countries in the South East Asian region. Had not these biorepositories been identified and established, the enormous research carried out from India on SARS-CoV-2 research and development of tests, therapeutics and vaccines would not have been possible in the last two years.

As a result, India is able to administer 7-10 million doses of vaccines each day, thanks to the efficient supply chain that was established as a result of this sharing mechanism. We believe that such a mechanism could serve as a positive precedent for policy changes, thus expanding this successful model to research on other biological samples.
