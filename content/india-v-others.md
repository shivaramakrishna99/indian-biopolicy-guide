To gain an idea on where India stands in terms of bio-policy in the global field, we looked into the shipping policies of countries, namely the United States of America, Germany and Australia, that were from three different continents. The following table summarizes the comparison:

Based on our efforts, we realised that India was not lagging behind in terms of updating its policies for biological shipping at the global front. The implementation of the 1989 Act serves as a great example for this. However, there exist lacunae in the Indian policies.
