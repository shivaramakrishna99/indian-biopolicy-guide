      A handy guide to shipment policies for biological materials within and
      outside the Indian region
    </h1>
    <p>
      To gain an overview of the shipping policies regarding biological
      materials, we began with a literature review that spans 3 decades. The
      ensuing two subsections would delineate policies for non-human and human
      samples along with an elaborate discussion on the guidelines stated in the
      same.
